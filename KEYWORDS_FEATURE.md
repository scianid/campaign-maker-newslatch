# Keywords Feature Implementation ✅

## Summary
Added automatic keyword generation to AI content items. The AI now generates 5-10 relevant keywords for each content piece, which are displayed in the UI and can be used for targeting and SEO.

## Changes Made

### 1. Database Migration ✅
**File**: `supabase/migrations/20251015_add_keywords_to_ai_items.sql`
- Added `keywords` column to `ai_generated_items` table
- Type: `text[]` (array of strings)
- Created GIN index for efficient keyword searches
- Applied manually to database

### 2. AI Prompt Update ✅
**File**: `supabase/functions/rss-feeds/ai.ts`
- Modified AI prompt to generate 5-10 keywords per content item
- Keywords include: industry terms, product types, locations, people, companies, topics
- Added to JSON output format

### 3. Backend Changes ✅
**File**: `supabase/functions/ai-generate/index.ts`
- Updated data mapping to save `keywords` field
- Keywords extracted from AI response and stored in database
- Deployed to production

### 4. Frontend Changes ✅
**File**: `src/components/AiContentPage.jsx`
- Display keywords as badges with 🔑 icon
- Emerald color scheme (distinguishes from purple tags)
- Shows first 3 keywords with "+N more" badge if more exist
- Hover shows all keywords in tooltip

## Visual Example

```
Card Header:
⭐ 85/100 High  📈 Breaking  📢 Published
🏷️ tax        🏷️ business    🏷️ compliance
🔑 taxation   🔑 SMB          🔑 finance      +4 more
```

## Usage

Keywords are automatically generated when:
- Running "Generate Ads" from campaigns page

Keywords appear in each content card as emerald badges below the tags.
